# Rock-Band-Controller-Remapper
A functional, yet ugly way to map a guitar band controller to keyboard keys. I turned mine into an entire keyboard.


This only works for Linux systems currently.
Install xboxdrv and xdotool on your system.

Run with `node index.js`.

Originally used the node-key-sender library, but I found it too hard to work with.
It was just a night project and I'm lazy since I just wanted to see if I could do it.

Do what you want with it.
